	<h2>iOS Application Basics</h2>

	<p>
		For an app to do something useful, though, it must be able to handle user interaction.
		In this lesson you learn some basic concepts involved in iOS application programming, and how to add interactivity to your apps.

		iOS programming is based on an event-driven model and is all about writing code to respond to one or more events.
		The device generates these events every time the user does something with the application. For instance,
		if the user taps a button, an appropriate “touch” event is generated by the device and forwarded to the application.

		Direct user interaction, although the most common reason for events, isn’t the only one.
		For instance, events are generated when the phone is receiving a call, when a file has successfully downloaded from a server, and so on.
		Practically anything that happens on an iOS device ends up generating one or more events.
		When an event is generated, the operating system looks into your program to see if a method in one of your classes should be notified.

		The key to iOS programming lies in knowing what these events are, and how to set your methods to be called when one of these events occurs.
		Figure below shows a simplified version of the sequence of events that occurs between the launch and termination of an iOS application.
		This sequence is also known as the application life cycle.

		At key points in the application life cycle, messages are sent to objects in the application to let it know what’s going on.
		iOS applications aren’t actually terminated when the user presses the home button on the device; instead they are moved to a background “suspended” state.

	<h3>Application States</h3>
	<p>
		At the heart of your code is a C-based function called main(). Xcode creates this function for you as part of the
		boilerplate code that is generated when you create a new project.
		Its main purpose is to serve as an entry point for your application and hand control to one of the classes in the UIKit framework.
		You should never have to modify the implementation of this function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every iOS application must have a class that implements the UIApplicationDelegate protocol.
		This class is known as the application delegate object and is responsible for monitoring the high-level behavior of your application.
		The application delegate object must implement a few key methods of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol that are used to handle critical events.
		In object-oriented terminology, a delegate is an object that implements a certain set of methods.
		These methods are then called by another object as and when needed.
		iOS applications can be in one of several states at any given point in time; these states are summarized in the below table.
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>State</td><td>Description</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Not running</td>
				<td>The application is currently not running.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Inactive</td>
				<td> The application is running, but not receiving any events. An application can stay briefly in this state while it transitions to another state.
				The only time the application remains inactive for a considerable period is when the system prompts the user to respond to some event such as an incoming phone call or SMS.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Active</td>
				<td>The application is running and receiving events.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Background</td>
				<td>The application is in the background and executing code. Most applications briefly enter this state on their way to being suspended.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Suspended</td>
				<td>The application is in the background and not executing any code.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</p>
	<p>
		At launch time, an application moves from the not-running state to the active or background state. During the initial startup sequence,
		the application delegate’s application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method is called, followed by either the applicationDidBecomeActive: or applicationDidEnterBackground: methods.
		These methods are, as you might expect, part of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol, and your application delegate must provide implementations for these.
		Typically, when you create a new project with Xcode, basic implementations are provided for you as part of the boilerplate code in the application delegate class.
