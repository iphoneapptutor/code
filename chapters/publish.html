			<h2>App Store Distribution</h2>
			<p>
				In most cases, after your app is ready and tested, you will want to list it on the App Store. Regardless of your pricing strategy (free or paid), every application that is submitted to Apple for distribution via the App Store is subject to an approval process. The approval process takes about a week. Updated versions of an existing application also need to go through an approval process.
			</p>
			<p>
				To distribute your application via the App Store, you will need a standard, paid, iOS developer account. If you have an enterprise iOS developer account, you cannot distribute your applications through the App Store. Submitting an application to Apple for inclusion in the App Store is a two-stage process. First, you need to create an Application Profile on the iTunes Connect portal, and then you need to submit your application binary with the Xcode Organizer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the steps involved in the second stage of creating and submitting the application binary are similar to the Ad Hoc distribution process.
			</p>
			<h3>Creating an Application Profile</h3>
			<p>
				To start the App Store submission process, log in to the iTunes Connect portal at https://itunesconnect.apple.com/ with your iOS developer account credentials. Once you have logged in to the portal, click the Manage Your Applications link.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				On this screen you will see all your iOS and MacOS applications. You can either add a new application, or manage one of the existing ones. To create a new Application Profile, click the Add New App button on the top-left corner of the window.
			</p>
			<p><img src="images/figure42.gif" alt="" align="middle" />
			</p>
			<p>
				You will be asked to select the type of application you want to submit (iOS or MacOS). Selecting the iOS App option will take you to the Application Information screen.
			</p>
			<p><img src="images/figure43.jpg" alt="" align="middle" />
			</p>
			<p>
				On this screen you need to specify basic information on the app. including an application name, a SKU code, and an application Bundle Identifier.
			</p>
			<p>
				ou will also need to enter a Bundle ID Suffix and verify that the bundle identifier specified in your Xcode project's info.plist file matches what is specified on this screen. The Bundle ID Suffix is typically the name you used while creating the Xcode project. The SKU code is not used by Apple, but is used to identify the application on the monthly financial report provided by Apple. Click Continue when you have finished entering this information.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next part of the process requires you to specify availability date and pricing information. The pricing category you select will affect the price your end users pay for your application. If you do not want your application to be available across all App Stores worldwide, you can select specific countries on this screen by clicking the Specific Stores link and then selecting individual stores.
			</p>

			</p>

				The Rating section consists of a series of questions, the answers to which determine a rating category for your application. The rating determines the parental controls that will apply to your application. As you change the answers to these questions, the age limit will change.
